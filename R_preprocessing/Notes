Do normalization methods affect analysis:
TSS (Done) (compositional)
CSS
UQ (Don't use)
RLE (alr) (Don't use)
TMM (Don't use - similar to TSS)
CLR (Built-in) (clr)
log10
Z

Use TSS as prevalence filter to remove from original
 - Abundance (detection) core member
 
Prevalence: How many samples must be present in (20) (move to 10 if too much is cut out)
Abundance: To what quantity (start with zero - just prevalence)

Steps:
1.) Prevalence and abundance filter
2.) subset original object
3.) Apply transforms (above) (also figure out what they are doing)
 - TSS (compositional) - normalize to percentages
 - CLR (clr)
 - log10 - logarithmic transform
 - Z
 - side note: summarize each transform type
4.) Command to get OTU table: abundances
5.) Command for taxa (if needed): taxa
6.) Save and change file type to .csv
6.) Put resulting tables back into VScode stuff (LDA)

Figure everything out on OTU for now
Later: try aggregating (level = XXX)
